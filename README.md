# Console-Finances

## Description

This repo utilizes the concepts learned in Javascript to address a real-world example. The task was to create code for analyzing the financial records of a company from a financial dataset which was provided. 

Skills used cover psuedocoding and the fundamentals of Javascript, including variables, for loops, math, multidimensional arrays and conditional logic. 

## Issues
I encountered difficulty in querying the 2D array so used a lengthy approach of extracting the data into a normal array, performing the required operations then querying indices of each new array to realign and retrieve the values required. This is due to my limited knowledge and inability to attain relevant information to adequately find the average of differences for 1 column in a 2D array, despite finding ample information for calculating the average of a column.
